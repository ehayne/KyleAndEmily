    <h3>How we got engaged</h3>
    <p class="personDescription">
      It was a warm late spring Texas day with a slight breeze on the wind.  Kyle and Emily decide to spend the afternoon at the Driftwood Winery they are members at.  A picnic bag was packed with the usuals but unbeknownst to Emily there wsa also a hidden treasure. After talking most of the afternoon away, Kyle began to tell Emily about how amazing the last 2 years of his life has been with Emily.  He then got down on one knee and ask if she would like to marry him.  She said YES!

    <h3>How we met</h3>
    <p class="personDescription">
      With 3 days left on Kyle's match.com account, and only 3 days into the start of Emily's match.com account (Emily always was the lucky one), little did the know, this would be the start of an amazing adventure.  After a few messages back and forth, Kyle cut to the chase and asked Emily to meet up at the local coffee shop.  It was a beautiful spring afternoon in downtown Austin, these two talked for hours before realizing they hadn't ordered their coffee or tea yet.  The rest, as they say, is history!
