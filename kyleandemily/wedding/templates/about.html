    <h3>How we met</h3>
    <p class="personDescription">
      With 3 days left on Kyle's match.com account, and only 3 days into the start of Emily's match.com account (Emily always was the lucky one), little did they know, this would be the start of an amazing adventure.  After a few messages back and forth, Kyle cut to the chase and asked Emily to meet up at the local coffee shop.  It was a beautiful spring afternoon in downtown Austin.  They talked for hours before realizing they hadn't ordered their coffee or tea yet.  The rest, as they say, is history!
